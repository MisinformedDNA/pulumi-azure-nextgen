Description: # Microsoft Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Provider (preview)
        
        The Microsoft Azure Resource Manager provider for Pulumi lets you use Azure resources in your cloud programs.
        This provider uses the Azure Resource Manager REST API directly and therefore provides full access to ARM API.
        
        The provider is currently in private preview:
        
        - Breaking changes are regularly introduced, including changes in SDKs, provider plugin, and state format
        - No artifacts are published in public package managers or Pulumi provider registry. You'll have to build them
        yourself in order to use the provider.
        
        To use this package, please [install the Pulumi CLI first](https://pulumi.io/).
        
        ## Configuring credentials
        
        Credentials configuration is compatible with the existing Terraform-based Azure provider.
        
        Please refer to [this quickstart guide](
        https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/azure/setup/) for possible configuration options.
        
        ## Building
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        - Go 1.13
        - NodeJS 10.X.X or later
        - Python 3.6 or later
        - .NET Core 3.1
        
        Please refer to [Contributing to Pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for installation
        guidance.
        
        ### Building locally
        
        Run the following commands to install Go modules, generate all SDKs, and build the provider: 
        
        ```
        $ make ensure
        $ make build
        ```
        
        When the commands succeed, your `GOBIN` directory should contain the `pulumi-resource-azurerm` executable.
        
        ### Running an example
        
        Navigate to one of the `examples` and run Pulumi:
        
        ```
        $ cd ./exampes/simple
        $ pulumi up
        ```
