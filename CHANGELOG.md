CHANGELOG
=========

## HEAD (Unreleased)

- Resolved an issue when some output properties were erroneously presented as input properties too
(notable example: `tier` in `sku` of a `storage.StorageAccount`)
- Added `appplatform.getResourceUploadUrl` and other `get*` POST-based invokes ([#11](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-azure-nextgen/issues/11))

---

## 0.1.0 (2020-09-21)
